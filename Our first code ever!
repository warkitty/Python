Hi class! We are Team 19! Our team is probably the best team ever, we like to call ourselves the {Plural_Noun}. 
We’d love to introduce ourselves to you one by one. Nick is the {Adjective} guy of the group, we call him that 
because he loves to eat {Food}. Nathalia, on the other hand, is incredibly talented at {Sport} in fact she has 
{Number} awards from the Tokyo Olympics. Anne is a professional {Videogame} player and is a streamer for one of 
the biggest groups in the world-- {Company} streamers united. Finally, we have Rui who loves to cook, 
his favorite dish is made from {Animal} meat. He says the best way to prepare it 
is to {Cooking_Method} it. 

As you can see, our team is made up of incredibly diverse people from different backgrounds and different 
hobbies. We have {Adjective} Nick, Nathalia the {Sport} master, Anne who works for {Company}, and Rui our 
resident {Animal} cooker. We hope you get to work with us in the future whether it be in the classroom or 
the {Place}!
