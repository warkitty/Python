# Python
I have been practicing Python doing my Master of Business Analytics. This is some of the cods developed. This are just basic and can still be improved. 

## Text Adventure
One of my frist Projects learning Python was a text adventure. I had a lot of fun making this. Here is some insight.

The game is about a person in the world of Entios how is asked to deliver a letter to the wizard in Latos and have to cross a forest or a mountain to get there. 
The roads giving him tasks and depending on what the player does, they might die, get sent back or just run through the game.

I used one of my intros in D&D and made it a bit simpler with some extra loops.
